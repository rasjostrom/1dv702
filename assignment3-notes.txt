1.1.2 Switch Behavior
---------------------
# Experiment 1
1.1 Identify MAC addresses of all 3 nodes & statically create
    MAC-IP mapping in each nodes ARP-table.

1.2 Connect PC and start capturing, then connect the laptops
    and start pinging.

# Report 1
- Explain traffic and why you could / couldn't capture it.
  sudo ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.x netmask 255.255.255.0 
  static arp: sudo arp -s 10.0.0.x xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

  Rasmus: 74:d0:2b:08:e8:c4 - 10.0.0.2
  John:   00:21:cc:c2:83:48 - 10.0.0.3
  PC:	  00:1a:a0:6a:08:f2 - 10.0.0.4
  
  No traffic from the pings were captured since the switch only forwards
  the traffic to the destination host.
  
- Explain why you could / couldn't capture the ARP traffic.
  Since we set all the MAC to IP mappings statically in each host, there
  was no need for any of them to send any ARP traffic. Thus, there were no
  ARP traffic in the capture.

# Experiment 2
2.1 Clear the ARP table mappings, but keep the IP addressing.
2.2 Disconnect all nodes and repeat step 1.2.

# Report 2
  As for the first experiment, the switch only forwards the ping traffic to
  the destination host address and is not displayed in the capture.

  Since we did not assign the MAC to IP mapping statically this time, there
  were ARP traffic shown in the capture.
  
# Conclusion: Compare experiments 1 and 2
- What differs between the captures, and why?

  The difference between the captured traffic in experiment 1 and 2 were
  the ARP traffic. Since we assigned the MAP to IP mappings in experiment 1
  statically, there was no sign of any ARP traffic in that capture. While
  in the experiment 2 capture file we could see the APR requests between the
  two laptops from the capturing PC.

1.1.3
Based on your observation of hub and switch behaviors, explain and motivate
the following questions:
- How different a switch tackles with collision domains compared to a hub.
  The hub has only got one collision domain, therefore there is a bigger
  chance for collisions. A switch on the other hand has one collision domain
  per port. This leads to reduced collisions.

- Did you observe a particular scenario where the switch acted like a hub? If
  yes, can the switch be forced to act like a hub?
  When it comes to broadcast traffic, the switch acts the same way as a hub.
  Otherwise, the switch only forwards frames to the destination device. This
  can be seen in the previous experiment, where we could see the ARP request
  but no response was shown to the third PC.

1.2 VLANs
1.2.1 Single Switch
# Experiment 1
- Connect one laptop to port X and the PC to port Y.
- Start capturing on the PC and then generate broadcast traffic
  from the laptop.
- Change the PC to port Z and generate broadcast again.

# Questions
- Explain traffic and why you could / couldn't capture it.
  When both hosts were connected to the same VLAN, we could both ping each
  other and the capturing PC could see the broadcast traffic generated by the
  other laptop. None of these things were however not possible when the two
  hosts were on different VLANs.
  
- What happens if you assign the same IP to two machines on different VLANs?
  Assigning the same IP to two hosts on different VLANs does not cause any
  issues what so ever since they are completely separated.

# Experiment 2
- Connect the second laptop and assign IPs so both laptops are on
  the same subnet. Connect laptop 1 to pyrt X and laptop 2 to
  port W. Initiate communication between the two.
  Communication between the two laptops on separate VLANs is not possible
  since none of the hosts can reach the other hosts virtual network.
  

# 1.2.2 Multiple Switches
# Experiment 1
- Connect Switch A to Switch B.
- Assign IP to both laptops on same subnet.
- Connect one laptop to Switch A port X
- Connect the other laptop to Switch B port X.
- Start capturing on laptop 2.
- Initiate unicast and broadcast towards laptop 2.

# Questions
- Explain the traffic and motivate why it was/wasn't possible to capture it.
  The two hosts connected to the different switches could not communicate or
  see eachothers broadcasts. This is due to the fact that no trunking has
  been configured in the switches.

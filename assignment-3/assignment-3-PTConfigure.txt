# Task 1 Examine the STP Default State
Determine the root bridge:
When clicking the 'Capture/Forward' button, we can see packets
starting from S6. This is the root bridge, which we then
confirmed by entering the CLI and ran the 'show spanning-tree'
command.

# Task 2 Configue the root bridge
By switching to real time mode and entering the command
'spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096' in the configuration
terminal in C1 we configured it to be the root bridge.


# Task 3 Configure the Backup Root Bridge
When C2 is configured as the backup root bridge, the links
between C2 and the distribution layer are amber while the links
going from C1 are all green.
